*Where Is My Plane?* is a platformer game which shows the adventures of a lost pilot, who will have to go through several maps where he will encounter deadly traps and enemies who will try to take him out before he escapes with his red biplane.

In this game you will have to show your jumping and precission skills to jump on tricky platforms surrounded by lava and avoid getting killed by deadly enemies.
